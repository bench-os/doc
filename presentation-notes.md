# Intro

## embedded world intro

## objectives

    theoretical analysis/summary
    benchmarking tool

## theory

    mind map?

# why the subject is important

## need of a new benchmarking tool

    source?

## interests of the community

    RIOT Summit 2018

# the process

## definition of a benchmark

    difference between workload and framework

## RTOS used

    Contiki
    RIOT
        cooperative scheduling fashion

## metrics

    context switching time

## different approaches

    inside of the kernel
    rtos extension approach
        definition of extension
        framework as extension
    devices approach
        workflow
        PSLab

# results

## how we gathered the results

    reference value
    oscilloscope
        photo

## overhead measurement

    comparisons of overhead
    discussion
## framework measurement

    assessment of the different approaches

# Conclusion

## demo? video ou live? photos du setup

## next steps

    add new metrics
    improve the devices framework

## parallel works

    benchmarking tools (embench)
