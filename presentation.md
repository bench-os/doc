# Introduction

## Embedded systems

1,000,000,000,000

## Objectives

- Theoretical summary
- Benchmarking tool

## Theory

TODO Mindmap here

# Why is this important

## Benchmarking tool for RTOS applications

TODO source

## Interest of the community

TODO RIOT Summit 2018

## link with communities

TODO contact with communities mailing list

# Developpement and implementation

## Benchmark definition

> > "A tool designed to assess the performances of a system."

In our case, a benchmarking tool to assess the performances of applications running on different RTOS

## RTOS

- Contiki
- RIOT
- (FreeRTOS)

## Metrics

- Context switching time

TODO cite others?

## Mutiple approaches

- Kernel approach
- Extension approach
- External devices approach

# Results

## Performances gathering

- Reference value
- Oscilloscope
- (Internal clock)
- (External device)

TODO discussion

## Framework measurements

TODO assessment of the different approaches

# Conclusion

## Parallel works
