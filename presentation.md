# Developpement and implementation

## Benchmark definition

> > "A tool designed to assess the performances of a system."

In our case, a benchmarking tool to assess the performances of applications running on different RTOS.

## RTOS

### Contiki
- Cooperative scheduling
- Event-driven

### RIOT
- Preemptive scheduling
- Multithreading

## Metrics

### Framework metric
- Context switching time

### Other metrics
- Interrupt latency
- Memory usage
- Power consumption

## Multiple approaches

### Kernel approach
Implementing the framework in the RTOS kernel.

- Tedious approach
- Strongly platform-dependent

### Extension approach
Implementing the framework as a RTOS extension.

- Contiki app and RIOT module
- Internal clock

### Devices approach
Implementing the framework with external devices.

- Pocket Science Lab board to measure the context switching time
- Laptop to communicate with the PSLab

# Results

## Performances gathering

- Reference value
- Oscilloscope
