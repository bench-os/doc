Our first result shows that our framework add a huge overhead.
We will use a real oscilloscope to have precise measurements.

We tought about using Python and send the data over UART.
But the overhead induce by Python would alterate the results.

Instead, we will keep using the board to compute the context switching time and use Python to average the value outputed by the board.
