The idea is to use the PSLab board to compute the context switching time.
Connecting the board through one GPIO we could be able to compute the context switching time.
A task in contiki should look like this:

```c
PROCESS_THREAD(task_1, ev, data)
{
    PROCESS_BEGIN();

    while (1)
    {
        bench_on();
        // Stuff happens here
        bench_off();
        PROCESS_PAUSE();
    }

    PROCESS_END();
}
```

the `bench_on()` call set up a dedicated GPIO up and the `bench_off()` call set down the same dedicated GPIO.

To see if the PSLab could read such value, we first need to check if a real oscilloscope is able to compute the correct context switching time with this new framework.

## Results with real oscilloscope

The results is the following:

    - Mean: 14.87us
    - Min: 14.79us
    - Max: 14.97us
    - Population: 80

As we can see, the oscilloscope compute the same value as with our previous experience (14.68us).

The next steps is to retrieve this value with the PSLab board.

## Experiments with the PSLab board

Using this code in Python3:

```python3
from PSL import sciencelab
I = sciencelab.connect()
I.MeasureInterval('ID1', 'falling', 'ID1', 'rising')
```

We get the value -0.0031587.
The negative sign means that the rising edge was first detected then the falling edge.
This does **not** gives us the context switching time.

I try to contact the PSLab community but I received no response yet.

Using Experiments desktop app, I manage to retrieve the 14us value of context switching time.
